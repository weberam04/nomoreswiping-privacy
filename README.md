<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

<p>No More Swiping ("the App") is developed and operated by No More Swiping LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding that information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Profile Information:</strong> When you set up the App, we collect your first name and preferences (such as your preferred Charlie companion gender). This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment Results:</strong> When you complete personality assessments within the App (such as attachment style, love language, dating persona, emotional availability, and self-awareness quizzes), your results are stored locally on your device. These results are used to personalize your experience with the App's AI companion feature.</p>

<p><strong>Conversation Data:</strong> Messages you exchange with the App's AI companion ("Charlie") are processed in real time to generate responses. Conversation text is sent to Anthropic's API (the AI service that powers Charlie) for the sole purpose of generating responses. We do not store conversation history on external servers. Conversation data exists only during your active session and in local device memory.</p>

<p><strong>Memory Signals:</strong> The App may extract brief factual notes from your conversations (such as your interests or life events) to help Charlie remember details about you across sessions. These memory signals are stored locally on your device.</p>

<p><strong>Photos:</strong> If you use the Photo Critique feature, selected photos are sent to Anthropic's API for analysis. Photos are not stored on any external server and are used solely for generating feedback during your session.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The App uses <strong>Anthropic's Claude API</strong> to power the AI companion and photo analysis features. When you interact with Charlie or use the Photo Critique feature, your messages and/or photos are sent to Anthropic's servers for processing. Anthropic processes this data in accordance with their privacy policy, available at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">anthropic.com/privacy</a>. We do not control how Anthropic handles data once it is transmitted to their servers, and we encourage you to review their privacy policy.</p>

<p>No other third-party services receive your personal data. We do not use analytics trackers, advertising networks, or data brokers.</p>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

<p>All personal data — including your name, preferences, assessment results, and conversation memories — is stored locally on your device using iOS standard storage mechanisms. We do not maintain external databases or servers that store your personal information. If you delete the App, all locally stored data will be permanently removed from your device.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>Your data remains on your device for as long as the App is installed. You can clear your conversation memories and assessment results at any time through the App's settings. Uninstalling the App permanently deletes all associated data from your device.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>The App is intended for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under 18, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>

<p>Because your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times. You can view, modify, or delete your data directly within the App or by uninstalling the App. If you have questions about your data or wish to exercise any privacy rights, please contact us at the email address below.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
